/**
 * 
 * * * You might have many environment variables in your project, and it's important to validate each one to ensure they are all present and correct.
 * 
 * 
 * * * You can either handle this manually or, preferably, use a validation library like Zod.
 * 
 * 
 * * * Zod is a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library that allows you to define and validate the structure of your data easily. 
 * 
 * 
 * * * We will be using Zod for various validation in the future, so we will also use it here to validate environment variables.
